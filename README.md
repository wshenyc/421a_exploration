# Map of 421-a Buildings in NYC

This [tool](https://wshenyc.github.io/421a_exploration/) helps tenants understand potential rent surcharges and changes to rent stabilization in buildings with expiring 421-a tax exemptions. It brings together information from the Department of Finance, Department of Buildings, and HPD, which can otherwise be difficult to access.

## Screenshots of the tool

## Coming next steps:
- [ ] Add GEA shapefile
- [ ] Track down the permit approved dates/construction end dates of ~300 records
- [ ] Methodology write-up
