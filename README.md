# Map of 421-a Buildings in NYC

This [tool](https://wshenyc.github.io/421a_exploration/) helps tenants understand potential rent surcharges and changes to rent stabilization in buildings with expiring 421-a tax exemptions. It brings together information from the Department of Finance, Department of Buildings, and HPD, which can otherwise be difficult to access.

## Screenshots of the tool

## Methodology Write Up

If you're curious to read more about my methodology, the challenges I faced, and some outstanding questions I’d love help with, here's a [Medium](https://ws2213.medium.com/when-421-a-starts-to-expire-what-happens-to-tenants-458dca2f7012) article with that info.

## Coming next steps:
- [ ] Add GEA shapefile
- [ ] Track down the permit approved dates/construction end dates of ~300 records
- [x] Methodology write-up
